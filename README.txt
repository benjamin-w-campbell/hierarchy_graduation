This is the replication archive for "Eigenvector Centrality Defines Hierarchy and Predicts Graduation in Therapeutic Community Units."

This archive includes the code and the data so that you can easily execute the analyses used in our paper.  

This is set up as an R Project file, so be mindful of that when replicating.  Open the .Rproj file in R Studio, 

Any questions related to the data may be directed to Dr. Keith Warren, warren.193@osu.edu.
Any questions related to the code may be directed to Dr. Benjamin Campbell, campbell.1721@osu.edu.

Each of these .Rmd files are R markdown files that contain the code necessary to replicate the analyses for "Eigenvector Centrality Defines Hierarchy and Predicts Graduation in Therapeutic Community Units."  

Simply update the established working directory and compile the .Rmd files to produce results.  
-HierarchyGraduation_Facility1_Women.Rmd: Notebook for analyses related to the facility 1 women's unit.  
-HierarchyGraduation_Facility1_Men1.Rmd: Notebook for analyses related to the facility 1 men's first unit.  
-HierarchyGraduation_Facility1_Men2.Rmd: Notebook for analyses related to the facility 1 men's second unit.
-HierarchyGraduation_Facility2_Men.Rmd: Notebook for analyses related to facility 2, which has 1 men's unit.
-HierarchyGraduation_Facility3_Men.Rmd: Notebook for analyses related to the facility 3 women's unit.
-HierarchyGraduation_Facility3_Women.Rmd: Notebook for analyses related to the facility 3 men's unit.  

The Data folder is accessed by these above Notebooks.

The PreviouslyCompiledResults folder contains runs of the notebook that were executed for the manuscript.  Any results produced should mirror the ones used.  If they do not, then compare to the last section regarding session info which may explain the differences.
